;;; Commentary:

;; Note: this package is still early stage.  I'm going to
;; support [nim-mode](https://github.com/nim-lang/nim-mode) first and
;; then other programming major-modes.

;; You can see the instruction here:
;;  https://github.com/yuutayamada/suggestion-box-nim-el

;; This package is more or less for major-mode maintainers who want to
;; show type information on the cursor and currently only tested on
;; nim-mode (https://github.com/nim-lang/nim-mode).

;; The tooltip will be placed above on the current cursor, so most of
;; the time, the tooltip doesn't destruct your auto-completion result.

;; ## Tutorial

;; - Step1: format string

;; ----------------
;; (progn
;; (require 'suggestion-box)

;; (cl-defmethod suggestion-box-normalize ((_backend (eql test)) raw-str)
;;    (format "foo %s bar" raw-str))

;; (let ((str "string"))
;;   (suggestion-box-put str :backend 'test)
;;   (insert "()")
;;   (backward-char 1)
;;   (suggestion-box str))) <- you can C-x C-e after the close parenthesis and
;;                             this will popup "foo string bar" on the cursor.

;; ----------------

;; - Step2: more complex logic (work in progress)
;;   this is just example of nim-mode.  Basically Nim's type signature is
;;   like this: "proc (a: string, b: int) {.gcsafe.}" and below
;;   configuration strip annoying part (outside of parenthesis).
;;   Output example: "a: string" if cursor is inside 1th arg's position.

;; ----------------
;; (cl-defmethod suggestion-box-normalize ((_backend (eql nim)) raw-str)
;;   "Return normalized string."
;;   (suggestion-box-h-filter
;;    :content    (suggestion-box-h-trim raw-str "(" ")")
;;    :split-func (lambda (content) (split-string content ", "))
;;    :nth-arg    (suggestion-box-h-compute-nth "," 'paren)
;;    :sep "" :mask1 "" :mask2 ""))
;; ----------------


;; - Step3: work with company-capf backend (work in progress)
;;   here is what I did in nim-mode:

;; ----------------
;; (defcustom nim-capf-after-exit-function-hook 'nimsuggest-after-exit-function
;;   "A hook that is called with an argument.
;; The argument is string that has some properties."
;;   :type 'hook
;;   :group 'nim)

;; (defun nimsuggest-after-exit-function (str)
;;   "Default function that is called after :exit-function is called.
;; The STR is string that has several property you can utilize."
;;   (when-let ((type (and str (get-text-property 0 :nim-type str))))
;;     (suggestion-box-put type :backend 'nim)
;;     (suggestion-box type)))

;; ;; note I simplified this function because it was too long
;; (defun nim-capf-nimsuggest-completion-at-point ()
;;   (list beg end (completion-table-with-cache 'nim-capf--nimsuggest-complete)
;;     ;; ... some properties ...
;;     :exit-function #'nim-capf--exit-function))

;; (defun nim-capf--exit-function (str status)
;;   "Insert necessary things for STR, when completion is done.
;; You may see information about STATUS at `completion-extra-properties'.
;; But, for some reason, currently this future is only supporting
;; company-mode.  See also: https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/583"
;;   (unless (eq 'completion-at-point this-command)
;;     (cl-case status
;;       ;; finished -- completion was finished and there is no other completion
;;       ;; sole -- completion was finished and there is/are other completion(s)
;;       ((finished sole)
;;        (when-let ((type-sig (get-text-property 0 :nim-sig str)))
;;          (cl-case (intern type-sig)
;;            ((f T) ; <- this means current completion was function or
;;                   ;    template, which needs "()"
;;             (insert "()")
;;             (backward-char 1)
;;             (run-hook-with-args 'nim-capf-after-exit-function-hook str)))))
;;       (t
